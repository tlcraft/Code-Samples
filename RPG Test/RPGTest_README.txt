This project was created in the summer of 2010. It is not complete but 
this program demonstrates a hierarchical inheritance design and a 
simple command-line interface.

This is just the beginnings of a tactical role-playing game. Similar to 
chess, characters can be moved around a grid and attack other characters.

In its current state the grid and actions between two characters are 
disconnected. Namely, two characters do not need to be near each other 
to attack.
